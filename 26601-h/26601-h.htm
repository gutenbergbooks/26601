<h2><a name="Introductory_Note" id="Introductory_Note"></a>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h2>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_i.jpg" alt="I" width="14" height="50" /></div>
<p>n collecting the stamps of Gambia one cannot too
strongly emphasise the necessity for guarding the
stamps of the "Cameo" series against deterioration
by the pressure of the leaves in an ordinary unprotected
album. In their pristine state with clear and
bold embossing these stamps are of exceptional grace
and beauty. Sunk mounts or other similar contrivances,
and a liberal use of tissue paper, should be utilised by
the collector who desires to retain his specimens in their
original state. A neat strip of card affixed to each side
of the page in an ordinary album will have the effect of
keeping the pages above from flattening out the embossing,
but tissue paper should be used as an additional safeguard.</p>

<p>We have to express thanks to Mr. Douglas Ellis,
Vice-President of the Junior Philatelic Society, for
his notes on the postmarks&mdash;of which he has made a
special study&mdash;and also for the loan of his entire
collection of the stamps of Gambia for reference and
illustration; to Mr. H. H. Harland for a similar
courtesy in the loan of his collection; to Mr. W. H.
Peckitt for the loan of stamps for illustration; to Mr.
D. B. Armstrong for interesting notes on the postal affairs
of the Colony; and to Mr. S. R. Turner for his diagrams.</p>

<p>To the first two gentlemen we are also indebted for
their kindness in undertaking the revision of the proofs
of this handbook.</p>

<h1>Gambia.</h1>

<h2>The Colony and Its Posts.</h2>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="46" height="50" /></div>
<p>he British West African possession known as
the Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia
occupies a narrow strip of territory (averaging
12 miles in width) on both sides of the Gambia
river. The territory comprises the settlement of St.
Mary, where the capital&mdash;Bathurst&mdash;is situated,
British Cambo, Albreda, M'Carthy's Island and the
Ceded Mile, a protectorate over a narrow band of land
extending from Cape St. Mary for over 250 miles along
both banks of the river.</p>

<p>The Gambia river was discovered by a Portuguese
navigator in 1447; under a charter of Queen
Elizabeth a company was formed to trade with the
Gambia in 1588. In the reign of James II. a fort was
erected by British traders at the mouth of the river
(1686), and for many years their only traffic was in
slaves. The territory became recognised as a British
possession under the Treaty of Versailles, and on
the enforced liquidation of the chartered company it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
was incorporated with the Crown as one of the West
African settlements. Until 1843, when it was granted
separate government, it was administered by the
Governor of Sierra Leone. In 1868 it was again
annexed to Sierra Leone, and not until twenty years
later was it created a separate Crown Colony with a
Governor and responsible government of its own. At
present the staple trade of the Colony is ground nuts,
but efforts are being made to induce the natives to take
up other products.</p>

<p>Postally there is little to record prior to 1866, which
is the date ascribed by Mr. F. Bisset Archer, Treasurer
and Postmaster-General, to an alteration in the scale of
postage, the half ounce weight for letters being introduced.
The rate to Great Britain was, we believe,
from that date 6d. per half ounce.</p>

<p>Mr. Archer also gives this year (1866) as the date
when the first postage stamps of the Colony were
issued. This date was for a time accepted in the
stamp catalogues, but it is now generally believed to
be an error, the earliest records in the stamp journals of
the period shewing the date to be 1869.</p>

<p>The postal notices we have been able to trace are of
but little interest, the following being all that bear on
matters of interest to collectors:&mdash;</p>


<h4>POST OFFICE NOTICE.</h4>

<h4><i>Reduction of Postage, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>On and from the 1st April, 1892, the Postage to all parts of

<h4>POST OFFICE.</h4>

<h4>Ordinance No. 6 of 1897.</h4>

<p class="f3"><i>March 11th, 1897.</i></p>


<p>1. This Ordinance may be cited as the Post Office
Ordinance, 1897, Inland Postal Regulations.</p>

<p>13. From and after the commencement of this Ordinance,
postal packets may be sent by post between such places in the
Colony of the Gambia and the Protected Territories adjacent
thereto as may be from time to time notified by the Administrator.</p>

<p>14. The Administrator-in-Council may from time to time
make in relation to the inland post hereby established such
regulations as he may think fit&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
For prescribing and regulating the places, times, and
modes of posting and delivery.</p>

<p>For fixing the rates of postage to be payable on inland
letters and postal packets.</p>

<p>For prescribing payment of postage and regulating the
mode thereof.</p>

<p>For regulating the affixing of postage stamps.</p>

<p>For prescribing and regulating the payment again of
postage in case of redirection.</p>

<p>For regulating the dimensions and maximum weight of
packet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span></p>

<p>For prohibiting or restricting the printing or writing of
marks or communications or words.</p>

<p>For prohibiting enclosures.</p>

<p>For restricting the sending or conveyance of inland letters.
</p></blockquote>

<p>and such other regulations as the Administrator shall from
time to time consider desirable for the more efficient working
of such Inland Post.</p>

<p>And may affix a penalty not exceeding ten pounds, to be
recovered summarily before the Chief Magistrate, or two
Justices of the Peace, or, in default of payment, imprisonment
not exceeding two weeks for a contravention of any such
regulation.</p>

<p>15. Any revenue derived from the Inland Post herein
established shall be paid into the Colonial Treasury at such
times and in such a manner as the Administrator shall direct,
and shall be applied to the general purposes of the Colony.</p>

<p>Insurance of and Compensation for loss and damage to
Parcels.</p>

<p>11. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, if any
article of pecuniary value enclosed in, or forming part of, a
parcel be lost or damaged whilst in the course of transmission
through the post, it shall be lawful for the Administrator to
cause to be paid out of the public revenues of the Colony to
any person or persons who may, in the opinion of the Postmaster,
establish a reasonable claim to compensation (having
regard to the nature of the article, the care with which it was
packed, and other circumstances), the following rates of compensation&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
(<i>a</i>) In respect of an uninsured parcel, such sum, not
exceeding twenty shillings, as he may think just.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In respect of an insured parcel the following scale
shall apply&mdash;

<p>We gather from the official handbook edited by Mr.
Archer that a Government steamer maintains weekly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
communication between the Capital, Bathurst, and
M'Carthy's Island both for passengers and mails.
There is no house-to-house delivery of mails at either
place.</p>

<p>Gambia joined the Universal Postal Union on
January 1st, 1879; the Imperial Penny Postage rate
was adopted from December 25th, 1898; and the unit
of weight for colonial and foreign letter postage was
raised from half an ounce to one ounce on October 1st,
1907. The Cash on Delivery system was introduced
on October 15th, 1908.</p>

<p>The following table gives an outline of the postal
business, the large fluctuations in the revenue being
chiefly due to the fluctuations in the demand for postage
stamps from dealers and collectors:&mdash;</p>

<p>The stamps were manufactured by Messrs. de la
Rue &amp; Co. by a double process of flat printing and
of relief embossing, the flat printing being doubtless
effected first and the embossing afterwards. This
combination was unusually effective, and the finished
stamps rank among the handsomest adhesive postage
stamps known to collectors.</p>

<p>As embossing evenly over a large area presented
considerable difficulties, the plates were made up of
fifteen stamps only, in three horizontal rows of five
stamps. The plates for both processes evidently fitted
each other with precision, though in the printing occasionally
the embossing is slightly out of register.</p>

<p>The paper is white wove and has no watermark,
and the stamps were not perforated. There are two
colours of the gum, one being the usual clear white:
the other is a pale yellow colour, which may, however,
be due to climatic influence, particularly as it is a noticeable
feature of a number of the later issues.</p>

<p>The colour of the 4d. value varies in shade from a
deep chocolate brown to brown and pale brown. The
6d. is pale to deep blue. There is a quite pale shade
which is very rarely met with, most of the so-called
"pale blue" specimens being an intermediate shade
better described as "blue."</p>

<p>The sheets of both values shew one printer's guide
dot in each side margin, opposite stamps No. 6 and
10 respectively (<a href="#Plate_I">plate I</a>).</p>

<p>Both values are known with the embossing shewing
a distinct double impression.</p>

<p>There are some peculiarities in these stamps which,
although their significance is uncertain, it may not be
well to overlook.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Firstly, there frequently occurs throughout the embossed
stamps of Gambia a small spot of colour on the
back hair, which in later embossed stamps becomes a
large spot, and even develops into a coloured indentation
from the coloured circular ground.</p>

<p>In this issue the spot, when it occurs, is usually quite
small, two copies of the 6d. examined shewing it somewhat
enlarged.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are noticeable varieties of the pendant
curl at the back. The normal design shews a fairly
thick wavy curl with a hair branching out from it into
the space between the curl and the neck. This sub-curl,
as we may call it, is occasionally missing, broken,
or as in No. 11 on the imperforate 6d. sheet (<a href="#Plate_I">plate I</a>),
the curl and sub-curl have joined together, giving a very
different appearance to the back hair. There are also
varying lengths of the main curl.</p>

<p>In the sheet of the 6d. value the plates seem to have
been slightly defective, and there is a gentle slope down
from the centre to the outside stamp on each side (Nos.
1 and 5), the slope being more pronounced on No. 5,
where the upper label containing the word Gambia is
recognised as the variety with slanting label. The left
side of stamp 5 is 22½mm. high, and the right side
22mm. That the peculiarity occurs reversed on stamp
No. 1, though it is less pronounced, there can be no
doubt. In later issues both stamps 1 and 5 shew the
defect more prominently, as will be readily seen from
an examination of plates <a href="#Plate_I">I.</a>, <a href="#Plate_X">X.</a>, and <a href="#Plate_XI">XI</a>. Curiously
enough, the fault is not confined to the two outside
stamps, as is generally supposed. The trouble is in the
entire top row being ½mm. taller than the normal stamps
of rows 2 and 3, except the left and right sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
respectively of the end stamps (Nos. 1 and 5). The
middle stamp of the top row shews a further peculiarity
in the shape of the base of the neck. (Compare plates
<a href="#Plate_I">I.</a>, <a href="#Plate_X">X.</a>, <a href="#Plate_XI">XI.</a>, with <a href="#Plate_XIV">XIV.</a>)</p>

<p>Copies of both values exist overprinted <span class="sc">specimen</span>,
and we have seen similar copies of all the regular issues
of this Colony.</p>

<h2>Issue of 1874.</h2>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="46" height="50" /></div>
<p>he introduction of watermarked paper for these
stamps occurred in 1874, the paper being that
familiar to collectors of British Colonial stamps
as watermarked "Crown C.C." The paper
was not readily adaptable for the small sheets of the
Gambia stamps, and the method of cutting it to suitable
sizes for these sheets has produced some varieties for
the specialist.</p>

<p>Major Evans, writing in the <i>Philatelic Record</i> for
January, 1883, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Most collectors are probably aware that the stamps of the
British Colonies printed in England are, as a rule, in sheets of
240, divided into four panes of 60, each pane consisting of ten
horizontal rows of six stamps. The Crown and C.C. watermarks
are arranged in the same manner upon the sheet of
paper; each pane is enclosed in a single-lined frame. Down
the centre of the sheet is a blank space of about half an inch
wide; across the centre is a wider space, watermarked with
the words <span class="sc">crown colonies</span>, which are also repeated
twice along each side of the sheet.</p>

<p>"Some of my readers may have noticed that the watermark
is not always very clearly shown in the Gambia stamps. This
is due partly to the fact of their being embossed, and partly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
their being arranged in small blocks of fifteen&mdash;three horizontal
rows of five&mdash;so that a row of five stamps is printed on a row
of six watermarks, and in most cases a complete watermark is
not found on any one of the stamps in a block. Very frequently
the upper and lower blocks on a sheet encroach on the margins,
and consequently some of the stamps show portions of the
words <span class="sc">crown colonies</span> in watermark; and I have seen a
block which had been printed in the centre of one side of a
sheet, and the middle row of which was watermarked
<span class="sc">colonies</span>, while the upper and lower rows bore the Crown
and C.C. Recent printings of some of the values of Gambia
show the blocks printed sideways on the sheet, in which case
each stamp will not show a complete watermark; and of these
again I have seen a block with the vertical division of the sheet
running across the central row."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition the stamps have been found with the
watermark reversed, indicating that occasionally a sheet
has been fed into the press the wrong side up. Inverted
watermarks of this Crown and C.C. type are
also to be found.</p>

<p>Of this issue, which comprises the same two values&mdash;4d.
brown and 6d. blue, imperforate&mdash;we get the
following variations in the watermark&mdash;</p>

<table class="tb3" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Crown C.C. </td><td align="left">upright (Fig. A).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">  "        </td><td align="left">inverted (Fig. C).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">  "        </td><td align="left">reversed (Fig. B).</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Portions of the words <span class="sc">crown colonies</span>.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" colspan="2">Bars (<i>i.e.</i>, division lines of the panes).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The gum shews the same variation&mdash;white and
yellow&mdash;as in the original issue. The 4d. stamp varies
in colour from deep brown to pale brown; the 6d.
deep blue to blue, the solid colour in this case presenting
a very mottled appearance.</p>

<p>Again, both values are known with the embossing
doubly impressed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Very few copies of the 4d. of this issue examined
shew the spot on the hair, but in the sheet of the 6d.
(<a href="#Plate_I">plate I.</a>) there are faint spots on stamps Nos. 1, 4, 5,
9, 12 and 13.</p>

<p>No. 11 on the same sheet shews the curl and sub-curl
joined.</p>

<p>The date of issue of these watermarked stamps is
uncertain, but the 6d. was chronicled in <i>Le Timbre
Poste</i> for December, 1874. The 4d. was not recorded
in any of the contemporary magazines, and
was probably not issued until some time after the
higher denomination.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="46" height="50" /></div>
<p>ogether with a number of other colonial possessions,
Gambia was admitted to the Universal
Postal Union on January 1st, 1879, and in
June of the following year (1880) a more
comprehensive series of postage stamps was issued, all
modelled after the same fashion as the two denominations
which had done service in the Colony for the
previous twelve years. The convenience of perforation
was adopted at the same time. The new series comprised
the following values, the shades being given in
the approximate order of printings&mdash;</p>

<p>The watermark on this issue appears variously upright
or sideways, varieties of each being inverted.
The normal "sideways" may be taken as from left
to right. Portions of the marginal lettering and the

<p>The subject of perforations is of peculiar interest in
this and the next issue of the stamps of Gambia, as
while to a certain extent the printings are to be
differentiated by shade the chief distinctions may be
made in the case of blocks and sheets by the perforations.</p>

<p>At first the stamps were perforated by a single line
machine gauging 14. A single line machine, as its
name implies, simply makes a single long row of holes
in one direction&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image_024_2.jpg" width="600" height="20" alt=""  />
</div>

<p>In the present case, where the sheets were so small, the
row is much longer than necessary, so in the sheets it
extends through the margins on all sides, as in <a href="#Plate_II">plate II</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The horizontal rows may be perforated first (one row
at a time), and then the sheet is turned sideways and
the vertical divisions are similarly perforated. A
peculiarity of this style of perforating machine is that
the points where the vertical lines cross the horizontal
lines rarely fail to fall foul of each other, and an effect
is produced like this&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_027.jpg" width="500" height="579" alt=""  />
</div>
<h4>Single line perforation. Note the crossing of perforated lines.</h4>

<p>In this manner it is possible to tell blocks and pairs of
this perforation without any side margins. Single
copies perforated in this manner can occasionally be
detected by the distance between the vertical perforations.
In the later perforation of this issue the distance
is fixed (as will be shewn), and the distance is 20½mm.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
measuring from perf. point to perf. point across the
stamp. Any stamp differing in width to any extent
more than ½mm. from 20½mm. may therefore be set
down as perforated by the single line machine.</p>

<p>We have seen all the values except the 2d. rose and
1/- green perforated by the single line machine, in
practically every case the C.C. watermark being upright,
the exception being a strip of three 6d. with the
sideways watermark. All the sheets with this perforation
appear to have one printer's guide dot in the centre
of each side margin.</p>

<p>The next form of perforating machine introduced in
later printings of the Crown and C.C. 1880 issue is
known as a comb machine. The comb machine perforates
three sides of a stamp at once, and the form of
the first comb machine was arranged thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image_028.jpg" width="600" height="84" alt=""  />
</div>

<p>The arrangement of the teeth of the comb fitted the
arrangement of the panes of the regular Colonial postage
stamps printed by Messrs. De la Rue &amp; Co., the
narrow spaced teeth in the centre marking the dividing
space between two horizontal panes.</p>

<p>In perforating the stamps of Gambia in the small
sheets of fifteen in three horizontal rows of five, both
sides of the machine appear to have been used, the
extreme end portion of the comb at either end running
off the side margin of the small sheet. When the left
portion of the machine was being used the sheet was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
inserted upright and the top row of stamps perforated
first, the effect being that the top margin is not cut
through by vertical perforations, and the bottom row is
(see <a href="#Plate_III">plate III</a>.).</p>

<p>When the right-hand portion was in use the sheets
appear to have been systematically inverted when
placed in the machine. This left the bottom margin
blank and the top margin cut through. Had the sheet
been simply inverted and perforated by the same portion
of the machine, as already described, the narrow spaced
teeth would have been produced on the left hand
margin instead of the right. A comparison of plates
<a href="#Plate_III">III.</a> and <a href="#Plate_VI">VI.</a> will shew that the narrow spacing is on the
right in both cases, but in III. the perforating has been
started at the top on the left side of the machine, and
in VI. from the bottom on the right side of the
machine.</p>

<p>It is possible that sheets exist with the narrow spaced
lines of perforation on the left side. We have searched
in vain for such varieties, but they may exist. A sheet
inverted when placed on the left side of the machine
would shew the top margin perforated through, and
narrow spaced perforation to left; while a sheet inserted
top first on the right hand side would leave the
top margin blank and the bottom one perforated through,
and the narrow spaced perforation to left.</p>

<p>This comb generally perforates so evenly that there
is no clashing of the perforations where the lines meet.
Occasionally, however, a sheet may get off the straight
and an irregular perforation occurs.</p>

<p>The sheets perforated in this machine generally have
one guide dot in the left margin, and three at the right
(see sheets <a href="#Plate_III">III.</a>-<a href="#Plate_VII">VII.</a>, <a href="#Plate_IX">IX.</a>-<a href="#Plate_XI">XI.</a>, <a href="#Plate_XIV">XIV.</a>, <a href="#Plate_XV">XV.</a>).</p>

</div>

<h4>Comb perforation. Compare crossing of perforated lines
with illustration on <a href="#page29">page 29</a>.</h4>

<p>The ½d. pale orange vermilion exists doubly perforated
at the top and sides.</p>

<p>A minor variety of the 2d. rose shews a small white
spot ½mm. from the nose. The stamp is No. 6 on the
sheet. The variety has been noted on several (not all)
the sheets of this value, and in various blocks, pairs
and singles.</p>

<p>The left and right hand top stamps (1 and 5) of the
6d. value shew the sloping label, which is now very
prominent (see <a href="#Plate_X">plate X</a>.).</p>

<p>All the values shew variations in the marks on the
back hair and in the curls.</p>

<p>All values exist with the embossing double; several

<p>The watermark Crown C.A. is uniformly sideways

(Fig. F.), but it may be found inverted (Fig. G.).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_036.jpg" width="500" height="175" alt=""  />
</div>

<p>The method of cutting up the sheets of Crown C.A.
paper was to guillotine the half sheets horizontally in
half and then twice vertically, dividing each horizontal
half into three small sheets, the half C.A. sheet of
paper yielding six small Gambia sheets (plates <a href="#Plate_XII">XII.</a>
and <a href="#Plate_XIII">XIII.</a>). The operators both at the guillotine and
at the press seem to have taken the utmost care to
arrange all the small sheets uniformly for passing
through the press, as the varieties shewing the watermark
from left to right are rare. The diagrams on
plates <a href="#Plate_XII">XII.</a> and <a href="#Plate_XIII">XIII.</a> will illustrate more clearly than
a verbal explanation the precise method of dividing up
the Crown C.A. paper.</p>

<p>The early printings of the Crown C.A. issue were
perforated with the comb machine described in the
previous chapter, but in the later printings a new
comb machine was introduced, which has not the
narrow spaced teeth in the margin, and, consequently,
has not the double row of perforation on the
right hand margins of the sheets. The perforations
produced by the two machines gauge the same,
and are not distinguishable in single specimens or blocks,
but only in sheets or specimens with pieces of margins.
The effect of the two different combs on the sheet may
be compared on the two sheets of the 6d. value illustrated
on plates <a href="#Plate_X">X.</a> and <a href="#Plate_XI">XI.</a> We may note (<a href="#Plate_VIII">plate
VIII.</a>) the second comb with the teeth extending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
through the top margin, leaving the bottom margin
blank, shewing that some of the sheets were perforated
from the bottom, which would produce this effect.</p>

<p>Unused imperforate copies exist of all values in the
following shades&mdash;</p>

<p>On some of the sheets of the ½d. value stamp 2
shews a slightly elongated left stroke of the letter m in
Gambia; No. 5 on the same sheet shews a similar
defect in the right stroke of the letter. (See <a href="#Plate_III">plate III.</a>,
which reproduction, however, only shews the variety
on stamp 2.) Stamps Nos. 1, 12, 13 on the same
sheet illustrated shew a peculiarity in the form of a
broken nose. We have not been able to trace other
copies shewing a similar defect, so possibly it is simply
due to over-inking or faulty inking of the colour plate.</p>

<p>The plate of the 3d. was altered in the final printing,
two additional printers' guide dots being added in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
left margin, and the top and bottom dot on the right
being removed (<a href="#Plate_VIII">plate VIII.</a>). This was printed in
pearl-grey only.</p>

<p>The early printings of the 6d. value shew the sloping
labels; they also shew the slight enlargement of the
stamps in the top row. These varieties occur in the
olive-green, bronze-green, and grey-green shades.
Later a new plate was made without the defect in the
top row, and this was printed in grey-green only.
(Cp. plates <a href="#Plate_XI">XI.</a> and <a href="#Plate_XIV">XIV.</a>)</p>

<p>It may be noted that there are two varieties of the
overprint on the <span class="sc">specimen</span> stamps of this series, one
having the letters sloping upwards from left to right,
the other being horizontal.</p>

was issued in reference to the postage stamps
of the Colony:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="sc">Withdrawal of Present Issue Of<br />
Gambia Postage Stamps.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On the 1st May, 1898, the present issue, if not previously
exhausted, of all denominations of Postage Stamps in the
Gambia that are then in the hands of the Government will be
destroyed, and a complete new set of stamps will then be put
in circulation.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span></p>

<p>After being faithful for nearly thirty years to the
graceful design of the "cameo" stamps the Colony
adopted the regular De la Rue type printed from a
general key plate which did duty for a number of
colonial issues.</p>

<p>Essays were prepared by making impressions from
this key plate, shewing the profile of the Queen to left
in a circle, and the words <span class="sc">postage&mdash;postage</span> at the
sides, the top tablet being left blank for the name of the
Colony, and a space for the sexagonal tablet of value at
bottom also being left blank. The essays consist of such
impressions with the name <span class="sc">Gambia</span> and the proposed
values painted in by hand, to shew the approximate
effect of the stamps which would be produced from this
key plate. Only a very few such essays are known.</p>

<p>The values which were actually produced in the new
series were&mdash;</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td align="left"> ½d. dull green and green (plates<a href="#Plate_II"> 2 </a>and <a href="#Plate_III">3</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 1d. carmine and carmine (<a href="#Plate_II">plate 2</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 1d. deep carmine and deep carmine (<a href="#Plate_III">plate 3</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 2d. orange and mauve (<a href="#Plate_II">plate 2</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">2½d. ultramarine and ultramarine (<a href="#Plate_II">plate 2</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 3d. mauve and pale ultramarine (<a href="#Plate_II">plate 2</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 3d. deep mauve and deep ultramarine (<a href="#Plate_III">plate 3</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 4d. brown and ultramarine (<a href="#Plate_II">plate 2</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 6d. olive-green and carmine (<a href="#Plate_II">plate 2</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 1s. violet and green (<a href="#Plate_II">plate 2</a>).</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>All the stamps were printed at two impressions, the
general design being printed from the key plate, and
the name <span class="sc">Gambia</span> and the value tablet by a "duty"
plate printed separately. In the ½d., 1d. and 2½d.
values, however, both key and duty plates were impressed
in the same colour. The plates are constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
to print sheets of 120 stamps, divided in two panes of
60 stamps each. The plate number appears in the
margin above and below each pane (<a href="#Plate_XVI">plate XVI.</a>). It
consists of an uncoloured figure on a circular ground
of colour, and is printed by the key plate. The plate
numbered "2" was used for all the values in the set,
but later printings of the ½d., 1d. and 3d. were printed
from <a href="#Plate_III">plate III</a>. In the case of the ½d. and 1d. the
printings from <a href="#Plate_III">plate III</a>. do not shew any marked variation
in shade; but in the case of the 3d. both the
mauve and the ultramarine colours are distinctively
deeper.</p>

<p>The perforation throughout gauges 14; the watermark
is Crown C.A. as in the last issue, but upright
instead of sideways, as these <span class="sc">postage&mdash;postage</span>
plates were constructed to fit the watermarked paper.</p>

<p>he change from the Queen's Head type to the
King's Head type of design came in 1902,
the new general Colonial key plate being used.
It is numbered 1 in a similar manner to the
numbering on the Queen's Head plates. All the
denominations in the previous set were repeated, and
a 2s. value was added; later (May, 1905) three new
stamps appeared of the face values 1s. 6d., 2s. 6d. and
3s. respectively. Of these three denominations it is
stated that only 6000<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> copies of each were printed.
The stamps, which were perforated 14 and were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
printed on the same paper (Crown and C.A.) as
the last issue, comprised the following values&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watermarked Crown C.A.</p>



<table summary="">

<p>In May, 1905, appeared also three
new values printed on multiple Crown
C.A. paper, each stamp shewing portions
of two or more watermark designs
instead of one more or less complete
design as heretofore. The new values
were the 5d., 7½d. and 10d. These
being rather unusual denominations,
their appearance caused considerable ferment among
collectors, who ascribed their issue to motives not
strictly associated with legitimate postal business.
Reference to the Post Office Ordinance No. 6 of
1897 (quoted in <a href="#Chapter_I">Chapter I.</a>) will shew that the fees
for insured parcels in force in the Gambia were 5d.
for compensation up to £12, 7½d. up to £24, and 10d.
up to £36; so it is not unreasonable if, as one may
assume, the colonists availed themselves of these rates
of insurance, that there was a use for such denominations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span></p>

<p>The new multiple watermarked paper had been
adopted for the 1d. value in 1904, and was during
1905-6 introduced for all the regular denominations
except the 1s. 6d., 2s. 6d. and 3s. On this paper,
therefore, we get the following&mdash;</p>

<p>Multiple Crown C.A.</p>

<p>he next and only remaining issue we have to
describe are in the nature of Provisionals
issued during a temporary shortage of halfpenny
and penny stamps. The Bathurst
correspondent of <i>Ewen's Weekly Stamp News</i>, writing
April 30, 1906, communicated the following information,
which is published in the issue of that journal for
May 26, 1906:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The surcharged penny and halfpenny postage stamps on
the 3/- and 2/6 denominations respectively were issued on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
10th instant, and withdrawn on the 23rd April. The issue
was necessary owing to a delay in receipt of a requisition for
stamps sent to England on the 9th February, and by the
abnormal sales, from some unknown reason, of the usual penny
and halfpenny stamps during February and March.</p>

<p>"A very small issue was made pending the arrival of the
mail on the 24th, by which the indent above mentioned was
received. The total issue was 4500 penny and 3780 halfpenny."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The stamps overprinted to provide these emergency
supplies were the 2s. 6d. purple and brown on yellow
paper, which was overprinted for the halfpenny, and
the 3s. carmine and green on yellow paper for the
penny overprint.</p>

<p>The surcharging was effected in the Colony. In the
case of the ½d. the overprint consists of the word</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
<td align="center">
HALF
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
PENNY
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>in two lines of block capitals, and below this are two
bars formed by ordinary printers' rules about 8½mm.
long cancelling the figures denoting the original value
of the stamp.</p>

<p>The type and rules were set up to overprint the
stamps thirty at a time (5 horizontal rows of 6 stamps);
thus the complete sheet of 120 stamps had to pass four
times through the press. There is a slight variation in
the distance between the bottom of the letters comprising
the word <span class="sc">penny</span> and the uppermost bar, in the third
and fourth rows of the setting. In rows 1, 2 and 5 the
bar is 5mm. away from the bottom of the type; in rows
3 and 4 it is only 4mm. distant.</p>

<p>The first stamp in the second row of the setting is a
variety in which the <span class="sc">e</span> of <span class="sc">penny</span> is broken and the word
reads <span class="sc">pfnny</span>. The only other variety occurring in the
setting is a slightly depressed <span class="sc">y</span> of <span class="sc">penny</span>. This occurs
in the first stamp in the 5th row.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The 3s. stamp was overprinted with the words "<span class="sc">one
penny</span>" in one line of small capitals. The overprint
was applied to a complete pane of 60 stamps at a time,
so that the entire sheet of 120 was surcharged at two
impressions instead of four, as in the ½d. on 2s. 6d.
stamp. The only varieties which have been recorded
of this <span class="sc">one penny</span> overprint are of slight defects, possibly
occurring only in particular impressions. It, however,
exists with the overprint double.</p>

<p>The issue of these two Provisional overprints, following
upon the appearance in 1905 of the 5d., 7½d. and
10d. stamps, brought a good deal of censure from
philatelists, who considered that the Colony was descending
to undignified means of increasing the revenue
by the sale of stamps to collectors. At the instance of
Lord Crewe an inquiry has lately been held into the
reasons for the emission of various Colonial postage
stamps, and the report of the Governor of the Gambia
is quoted in the printed report of the Commission:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The Governor of the Colony states that as the supply of
the ½d. and 1d. stamps had been exhausted before the arrival
of a new supply which had been ordered, no [regular] stamps
of these denominations were available from the 2nd to the 10th
April, letters requiring such postage being stamped 'Postage
Paid.' The surcharged stamps were on sale from the 10th to
the 24th of April, the date on which the new supply became
available. A surplus was left over, which was destroyed with
proper precautions."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The unsold balance of the Provisional ½d. stamps on
hand was destroyed "under direction from the Secretary
of State and by a special Board appointed by His
Excellency the Acting Governor" on October 16,
1906. How small the "unsold balance" was is not
stated.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h2>Notes on the Postmarks.</h2>

<h4>By <span class="sc">Douglas Ellis</span>.</h4>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="46" height="50" /></div>
<p>he first Gambia stamps appeared early in 1869,
and postmarks of that year are usually composed
of a circle with "Gambia" across the centre
in a straight line, and the date in two lines
below and a control letter above.</p>

<p>This postmark is usually in red, but is also found in
black. It was apparently only in use for a short time,
being superseded by a circular postmark of the same
size, but with "Gambia" at top and "Paid" at
bottom, both following the line of the circle.</p>

<p>The day and month are in a straight line across the
centre of the circle, with the year (last two figures only)
below and a control letter above. This, in the early
dated specimens, is A, followed by B and then C.
The postmark is always in red down to the early part
of 1887.</p>

<p>On the early imperforate stamps we find a similar
postmark in black, but lettered "Gambia" above and
"Unpaid" below. This was probably intended for
use on letters posted without a stamp. The control
letter is A.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span></p>

<p>From 1887 to 1892 the Gambia-Paid postmark
appears in black. The control letters are B or C.</p>

<p>In 1892 this was superseded by a fresh cancellation
with "Bathurst" above and "Gambia" below, both
following the line of the circle, the date across the
centre as before, and the control letter being C.</p>

<p>The lettering may be found in two sizes; on one the
distance between the B of Bathurst and the G of
Gambia is 3mm. and on the other 6mm.</p>

<p>In 1895 the control letter C was replaced by a six-pointed
*, and this cancellation is still in use.</p>

<p>About 1901 a special postmark for Registered letters
was brought into use, consisting of a large ellipse with
"Registered" above and "Gambia" below, both
following the line of curve, and with date in centre
and control letter above, either B or C, the latter
often being found reversed or upside down. This
is still in use.</p>

<p>From 1895 onwards stamps may be found cancelled
with a circular postmark with "Received" above and
"Gambia" below, and either a control letter C or a
six-pointed *. Possibly this was a Fiscal cancellation
wrongly used on postage stamps.</p>

<p>Most Gambia stamps, from the C.C. perforated
issue onwards, may be found with a cancellation consisting
of seven parallel bars forming a circle of 19mm.
diameter, the two outside bars being rounded off to form
part of the circle. Though this can be found on the
last issue of Queen's Head stamps, it does not appear
to be now used.</p>

<p>On the 1887 and later issues we find a cancellation
composed of four concentric circles, the diameter of the
largest being 18mm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Many letters appear to have been posted on board
the mail steamer, or sent from the post office without
the stamp being cancelled, as Gambia stamps are found
with the mail steamer postmark, which consists of two
circles with "Paquebot" above, and either "Plymouth"
or, "Liverpool" below, both being between
the two circles.</p>

<p>The date, comprising not only the year and month
but day and hour, is in three lines in the centre.</p>

<p>Many Gambia stamps can also be found postmarked
"Freetown, Sierra Leone," or "Registered, Sierra
Leone," but as we have no record of Gambia stamps
being used to defray postage from Sierra Leone, we
must conclude that they were sent on by a steamer
which did not possess a post office, and cancelled at
Sierra Leone before being shipped on the mail steamer.</p>

<p>Stamps of Gambia can also occasionally be found
with the postmark of the French Colony of Senegambia.</p>
